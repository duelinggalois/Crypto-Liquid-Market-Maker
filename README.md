## Crypto Liquid Market Maker

I created this strategy in an attempt to automate small gains repeatedly. A set amount is intended to be allocated to the strategy and as pairs of buys and sells execute over time, profit is generated. As a price is dropping, this strategy will repeatedly buy more crypto, as prices rise, it sells more. If the range of price breaks out of the trading range that is set, no more trades will execute unless the price returns to the range. This is not financial advice and this program can result in losses. Use at your own risk.

This program will list a sequence of buy and sell trades on pro.coinbase.com based on the following parameters:
* trading pair (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, LTC-USD, BCH-USD, BTC-ETH, LTC-BTC, etc)
* budget
* minimum trade size
* trade increase increment
* low sale price (high price currently set automatically)

**Recommended Installation**
* [Install Python3](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3)
* [Install PipEnv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
* `git clone https://github.com/rev3ks/Crypto-Liquid-Market-Maker`
* `cd Crypto-Liquid-Market-Maker`
* `cp config.py.default config.py`
* Add Coinbase Pro API passphrase, keys, and secret to `config.py`
* `sudo pipenv install` (dependencies managed by `Pipfile` in project root)
* `pipenv run python -m trader`

**Alternatively run from the command line**
```
$ pipenv shell
$ python -m trader --pair ETH-USD --budget 10000 --minsize .01 --sizechange .001 --lowprice 20 [--highpirce 1000 --live] 
```
without the `--live` flag trades witll be listed on the coinbase pro test exchange, with it, trades will be sent to the live exchange.

**Running Tests**
Please note that one test will create a limit buy order at a fraction of the current market rate of BTC-USD and then cancel it. When the market rate is $10,000/BTC the order would be 0.01 BTC at a rate of $100 and would require a balance of $1 All other tests execute in the Coinbase Sandbox for fake crypto and fake money. If you do not want this test to send a trade, don't add your keys and the test will then fail when trying to send the order to coinbase.
* Add Coinbase Pro Sandbox API passphrase, keys, and secret to `config.py`
* `pipenv run nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package=trader`

**Work In Progress**

Trading manually on coinbase for two years was a great inspiration to learn python. I still have a lot to learn and this is an outline of what I am currently working on:

* Adding test where missing
* Adding database
* Storing trading data into a database for analysis and computing tax basis and proceeds automatically.
* Improving interface options for initialization.
