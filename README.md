## Crypto Liquid Market Maker

I created this strategy in an attempt to automate small gains repeatedly. A set amount is intended to be allocated to the stategry and as pairs of buys and sells execute over time, profit is generated. As a price is dropping, this strategy will repeatedly buy more crypto, as prices rise, it sells more. If the range of price breaks out of the trading range that is set, no more trades will execute unless the price returns to the range. This is not financial advice and this program can result in losses. Use at your own risk.

This program will list a sequence of buy and sell trades on GDAX.com based on the following parameters:  
* trading pair (BTC-USD, ETH-USD, LTC-USD, BCH-USD, BTC-ETH, LTC-BTC, BCH-BTC)
* budget
* minimum trade size
* trade increase increment
* estimated trade price
* midpoint (optional)
* highest sale price

**Recommended Installation**
* [Install Python3](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3)
* [Install PipEnv](https://docs.pipenv.org/)
* `git clone https://github.com/rev3ks/Crypto-Liquid-Market-Maker`
* `cd Crypto-Liquid-Market-Maker`
* `cp config.ini.default config.ini`
* Add GDAX API passphrase, keys, and secret to config.ini
* `pipenv install` (dependencies managed by `Pipfile` in project root)
* `pipenv run python -m main`

**Example of Using Main**

See below if you would like python shell instructions to import modules.

**Alternative use from a python shell**

```
>>> from trading_algorithm import TradingTerms 
>>> ETH_BTC = TradingTerms(pair, budget, low_price, mid_price, min_size, size_change)
>>> ETH_BTC.print_trades()
```
See *Printed Trades for Reveiw* for `print_trades()` output.
```
>>> ETH_BTC.start_ws_trade()
```
See *Output* for `start_ws_trade()` output.

**Manual Adjustments**

As trades execute, the proceeds are relisted for at a margin. For example after three trades were sold in a single price movement in the `ETH-BTC` pair, the `trading.adjust()` function relists those trades:

```
#python3.6
>>> trading.adjust('ETH-USD', 'buy', .01, .0025, 655.56, 18.68, 5)

```

This will be automated once the websocket is completed. 

**Work In Progress**

Trading manually on GDAX for two years was a great inspiration to learn python. I still have a lot to learn and this is an outline of what I am currently working on:

* storing trading data into a database for analysis and computing tax basis and procedes automatically. 
* Cleaning up my code to be better organized and easier to understand.
* implementing unit testing.
* Implementing new ideas into strategy like using percentage change rather than a fixed change in price or fluxuating frequency rather than increasing each sequential trades value to achive the same goal.
